## About the project

This is a collection of resources to make organizing meetups easier. 

Every time I organize a meetup, I end up providing the same details to the venue. This is a common place to find them, with a bonus that others can benefit from these resources too.


## Resources 

- [Instructions for host venues](host-instructions.md)

- [Poster templates](poster-templates.md)
