# Host instructions

As soon as the date is confirmed, we should plan an agenda.

Please provide the following information as soon as possible, so we can start planning the event: 

- Arrival time - when doors can open to visitors (usually between 17.00-18.00)
- Closure time - when everyone has to be out and space cleaned up (ideally after 21.00 to allow for some mingling time)
- Attendee limit
- A short description on how to find the location
- Any custom text for the event description - if you like
- Is there a talk by someone from the host company? Do you want to make additional remarks before or after the talks, f.ex. mention your open jobs?

## Arrival & directions 

Hang up visible signs on the entry to the building, and inside, leading the way to the room where the event takes place. Make sure there are signs near stairs and doors, pointing the  right direction. Sometimes it makes sense to put a sign on the way to the building, if the entrance is hard to find. Make sure the sign has contact information. (use [this template]() and print as many as you need)

Make sure doors are _open_, at least until the talks start. If any door is locked and needs a key or code, make sure there is someone standing there to let the guests in during arrival time. Ideally it would be your own employees, but organisers can help too - just let us know in advance in case you have many doors, as there might be only one organiser on site.

## Location prep

Set up the chairs with reasonable distance, as well as a screen (or projector) and a speaker desk and seat, or stand. There should be a socket nearby the speaker stand, so they can plug in a charger. 

Ideally there should be someone on-site who used this equipment before, so they can help the speakers in case there are any issues. It’s a good idea to test the setup before the event starts. 

Background lounge music works really well for mingling time, so if you have a speaker - connect that too. 

Set up the area where the food will be served. Place napkins and hand sanitiser in reasonable amounts. 

Hang one or two signs pointing at where the bathrooms are. It’s a good idea to mention the bathroom locations during the welcome message too. 

## Food 

The food should arrive by the time the doors open or shortly after - at least 30 min before the talks start, so the guests have time to enjoy it before sitting down.

For safety, portioned food should be served. Sandwiches, wraps, salads (or anything else creative). Pizza and chips were common before corona, but now it doesn't seem smart anymore.

Make sure there are vegan options (around 30%) and that they are marked.

Order as many items as RSVPs + account for any employees staying for the event. Usually slightly fewer people show up, so there will be extra food in case someone joins unexpectedly. 

## Attendee limit 

It’s better to limit the amount of attendees than to provide bad experience. Check how many chairs can comfortably fit in the area (with some distancing), plus a few standing spots are also okay. 

## Event agenda

Usually it looks something like this:

> 17.30 Doors open
>
> 18.20 Welcome speech 
>
> 18.30 Talks ... (with or without breaks, depending on how many)
>
> 20:00 Mingle
> 
> 21:00 End 

As a host, you can say a welcome speech (optionally with slides). Here you can talk about your company or open jobs. You can also make closing remarks after the last talk in the same manner. If not, the organisers will say a few words instead.
